# Sharing Bussiness logic between React Native and Web
I'm on my way to write (and code) a realistic way of achieving reusing domain between both native and web apps. I'll use and adaptation of Clean Architecture and some Domain-driven design.
This is a realistic approach, what I mean by that is: It's simple enough to be applicable and Robust enough to have it in a production environment.

# Work in progress
I've been pretty busy lately, so I'll write as much as possible.
